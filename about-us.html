  <h3>Our Lab</h3>
  <p>Crown Dental offers crown and bridge, all ceramic, zirconia restorations and veneers. Our restorations are made in the U.S.A and we do not outsource to foreign laboratories.</p>
  <p>Glenn Hopkins, President and owner, is a CDT, with over 30 years experience. He regulary attends seminars and continuing education classes to maintain his certification and expand his knowledge in the field. We are also members of the MACDL and the NADL.</p>
  <p>Our goal is to provide our customers with high quality esthetic restorations, and to provide them with the excellent cusotmer service they expect and deserve. Every case receives the same careful attention and if we ever fail to meet your expectations, we'll work to make it right. We are proud of the longstanding relationships we have with our customers, and we welcome the opportunity to demonstrate this same commitment to you and your patients.</p>
